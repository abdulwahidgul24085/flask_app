# Flask framework
The flask framework is one of the well know python framework out there. It is one of the best choice in web development, with extreme flexibility in mind. Since flask can be used for delpoying machine learning to product, as a micro server, or complete web application. But it's not all prefect.

With the complete fredom for the develop on how to use the flask framework. It can be daunting task for a beignners and some time intermidate program to get the full benefit of this awesome framework. 

This repo is my straggle and chance to give back to the wonderful community. I am going to use as many resources that I can find around the flask framework, and create a jumping of point for the following options.

1. web development
2. machine learning project deployment
3. microservices
4. API only app.

I know flask can do all of this and a lot of online resource can help you achive this. But based on my experince. Most of the time, I have to visit different site to get the most basic functionality that flask provides. I am going to create a jump off point for the above mention project. I will try to add as many comment in the code so that you can just read about them in the code, with out going online or access cheetsheet. My problem can better understood by the following qoute
> are you in a hurry, or are in a haste.


The idea is that most of the time we forget the basic stuff that needs to make the application accessable for secure, since we just want to run the product or launch the idea.

You own research is highly appreciated, and also read up on flask. 

# Virtual Environment
In my opiton the base way to work with flask on your local machine is to use virutalenv. The reason is due to the fatch the conda or miniconda addeds additiaonal libaries when you create an environment with them. virtualenv does not add anything. To install [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/1.7.1.2/)
